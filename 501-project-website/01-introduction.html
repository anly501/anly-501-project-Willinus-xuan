            <p>
                With rise of social media coupled with the Covid-19 pandemic, cyberbullying has reached all time highs. We can combat this by creating models to automatically flag potentially harmful tweets as well as break down the patterns of hatred. As social media
                usage becomes increasingly prevalent in every age group, a vast majority of citizens rely on this essential medium for day-to-day communication. Social media’s ubiquity means that cyberbullying can effectively impact anyone at any time
                or anywhere, and the relative anonymity.
            </p>
            <p>
                My topic revolves around automating cyberbullying detection by leveraging machine learning methods. Cyberbulleying is a long-exsiting issue that concerns us. During to the Covid-19 pandemic, we rely more often on social media , which might expose us with
                cyberbullying.
            </p>
            <p>
                My question divides into 10 part, and I would conduct the research experienment to elaborate them.

                    <p>
                        The problem of violence and abuse is the greatest challenge the Internet faces today. According to the United Nation's 73% of women have already been exposed or experienced some form of online violence. It is a significant issue that cannot be fixed with
                        simple and easy solutions this is because cyberviolence and online abuse is much bigger than the average person, and much more complex than the snarky attitudes we see in the comment sections or the obvious violent threats.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this research project, I define hate speech to be contained sexism or racism speech in the tweets.

                    <p>
                        Twitter is widely used throughout the world. Much as there is a large-scaled layoffs reported by News in the recent months, few can shake its hegemony in social media.

                    <p>
                        By using tweepy, which is a official API for developer of tweeter, I can leverage the tweepy to scrape tweets and download them to analyze the text data.

                    <h2>What is the previous work to detect hate speech? </h2>
                    <p>
                        Practitioners in NLP field has conducted countless research to deal with hate speech detection. Some uses traditional ML techniques like logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, and so on . Others implemented it by even using DL techniques.
                        For instance, Bidirectional LSTM model, Convolutional Neural Network, or different variants of transformers model adding the self-attention mechanism are all separately used.

                        Although text data should be the most important factor to predict hate speech, by leveraging the account informaiton, I can input more related variables into the models. To be specific, the numbers of followers, likes, retweets, etc. could be possible
                        to influence the model performance.

                    <h2>How to observe the hate speech by machine learning techniques? </h2>
                    <p>
                        The research uses Support Vector Machine, decision tree and naive bayes to build the classification model. Support vector machine creates high-dimentional hyperplane to divide the data. Compared with the other two, it outstands in small data set, but
                        slower in performance once in bigger data set.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Decision tree, on the other hand, either adopts the Gini Index or cross entropy, to separate the data by initilizing a set of rules, which called internal nodes; The naive bayes is widely used and it is seen as a stepping stone or baseline for more complex
                        ML/DL techniques.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each of them has unique advantages. Since it is a research project, I really want to dive in and compare the permance of the three classic models. Besides, I also leverage unsupervised-learning ML techniques like clustering and association rule to unearth
                        more results.

                        Of the three classification models, the Polynomial Support Vector Machine performs the best. The decision tree is easy to be overfitting. Therefore, using bagging method of Random Forest can largely reduce the variance.

                        <strong> NLP is a very wide and complex field.</strong> Trying to predict the hate speech by only using traditional ML techniques is not plausible. This research project can be conducted further by using DL techniques. DL models
                        such as Recurrent Neural Network, involve more parameters into the model can be relied on. We can add attention layer and use bidirectional LSTM to solve vanishing gradient problems met in the vanilla RNN. We can also use transformer
                        models like Bert or GPT-2 to improve the model efficiency and effectiveness by using <b>self attention mechanism.</b>
