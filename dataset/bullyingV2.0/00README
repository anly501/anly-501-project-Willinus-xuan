Bullying Traces v2.0
September 2014

*****************************************************************************
What's new in v2.0

1. We add a new file tweetID_userID_category_authorRole_tease.csv, which includes 
the tweet ids and user ids along with the annotations.  As per Terms of Services 
of Twitter, the original tweets are not included in this dataset.  Researchers who 
need the original tweets may query them with these ids through Twitter APIs. 
Please refer to
https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/statuses/lookup 
or 
https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy (A python package to interact with APIs)
The annotation information in tweetID_userID_category_authorRole_tease.csv
is the same as in other files.

2. 13 of the 1762 tweets now have a slightly different Bag-of-Words vector compared
to v1.0 due to better text preprocessing.  

*****************************************************************************

This dataset contains data collected from Twitter stream API and labeled by 
experienced annotators for the study of bullying traces in social media.  We 
collected tweets using the public Twitter stream API, such that each tweet 
contains at least one of the following keywords: "bully, bullied, bullying". 
We further removed re-tweets by excluding tweets containing the acronym "RT." 
Our annotators labeled 1762 tweets uniformly sampled from the ones collected 
by the above procedure on August 6, 2011.  The tweets are cased-folded and 
tokenized, but without any stemming or stopword removal. Any user mentions 
preceded by a ``@'' were replaced by the anonymized user name ``@USERNAME''. 
Any URLs starting with ``http'' were replaced by the token ``HTTPLINK''. 
Hashtags (compound words following ``#'') were not split and were treated as 
a single token. Emoticons, such as ``:)'' or ``:D'', were also included as 
tokens. Our features include both unigrams and bigrams that appear at least 
twice in the 1762 tweets.

----------------------------------Format-----------------------------------

The feature vectors are written in a sparse vector format as commonly used 
in SVM-light.  Each line corresponds to one tweet and has the format:

Label featureIndex:value featureIndex:value featureIndex:value ...

Only features with a nonzero value are listed.  Each vector is normalized
to have norm 1.



----------------------------------Content----------------------------------

vocab
	The vocabulary file for all features. Each line is a token and the 
	index is the line number, starting from 1.

tweetType
	This corresponds to "NLP Task A: Text Categorization" in the paper.
	It contains 1762 feature vectors for all the labeled tweets. 
	Labels: 1 bullying trace, -1 not bullying trace
	
authorRole
	This corresponds to "NLP Task B: Role Labeling / Author's Roles". 
	It contains the 684 feature vectors for the bullying traces only.
	Labels:	
		1 Accuser
		2 Bully
		3 Reporter
		4 Victim
		5 Other

teasing
	This corresponds to "NLP Task C: Sentiment Analysis" in the paper.
	It contains the 684 feature vectors for the bullying traces only.
	Label: 1 Teasing, -1 Not teasing

tweetID_userID_category_authorRole_tease.csv
	This contains the tweet ids, which might be useful to retrieve tweets from 
	Twitter APIs. Each line corresponds to one tweet and has five fields 
	separated by commas:
	Tweet ID, User ID, Bullying_Traces?, Author_Role, Teasing?
	The possible values for Bullying_Traces?: 
		Y (bullying trace) 
		N (not a bullying trace)
	The possible values for Author_Role
		Accuser
		Bully
		Reporter
		Victim
		Other
		NA - The tweet is not a bullying trace and we didn't annotate its author role
	The possible values for Teasing?
		Y - Teasing
		N - Not teasing
		NA - The tweet is not a bullying trace and we didn't annotate if it is teasing
